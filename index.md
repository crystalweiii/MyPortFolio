Rebirth is a third-person adventure thriller game where the player assumes the role of a lost spirit in his journey towards acceptance. 
Using possession abilities, the player needs to navigate and avoid other evil spirits in order to regain his memories and successfully reincarnate.
The game focus more on storytelling and the immersive environment to help in making the player feel like the character they are players as.

Dont Touch My Loot is a Playstation 4 game that mixes tower defense with dungeon building. 
Set underground, the player has to protect his core from the evil heroes with monsters. 
The player must strive to create a maze inside the dungeon so the Hero would be lost inside and buy time for the player to build up his army of monsters to crush the hero.
